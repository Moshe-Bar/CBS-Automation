# Supercharged Web Scraping with Asyncio

Web scraping is simply automatically opening up any website and grabbing the data you find important on that website.
It's fundamental to the internet, search engines, Data Science, automation, machine learning, and much more.

*Opening* websites and *extracting* data are only part of what makes web scraping great. It's the parsing of the data
that's where the value is.

This project will cover:

- Basic web scraping with Python
- Web scraping with Selenium
- Sync vs Async
- Asynchronous Web scraping with Asyncio

Requirements:

- Python experience (at least the first 15 days
  of [this project](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/projects/30-days-python-38/)).
- Selenium & [chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/) installed (watch how
  in [this one](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/projects/30-days-python-38/day-16-use-selenium-scape-automate-behind-password))
  .
